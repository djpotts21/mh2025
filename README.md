# MH2025: Mental Health Journaling and Peer Support Platform

## **CURRENTLY STILL IN BUILD**


MH2025 is an anonymous, secure, and supportive web platform that empowers users to express themselves through journaling, connect with peers for support, and access helpful resources—all within a safe, moderated environment.

## 🌟 Features

- ✍️ **Private Journaling:** Write freely with timestamped, private journal entries.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Anonymous Peer Support:** Connect in group chats or 1:1 conversations without revealing your identity.
- ⚠️ **AI-Powered Moderation:** Automatically flags content related to crisis, self-harm, or abuse and directs users to support resources.
- 🛡️ **User Safety First:** End-to-end user protection via JWT authentication, rate-limiting, and moderation pipelines.
- 📱 **Mobile-Ready UI:** Clean, friendly, and responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS and Next.js.

## 💡 Vision

We believe everyone deserves a safe space to talk, reflect, and heal—especially those struggling silently. MH2025 is a digital sanctuary where mental health is respected, voices are heard, and peer connection is made possible without stigma or judgment.

- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime)
- **Authentication:** Custom username/password with secure recovery keys
- **Moderation:** OpenAI-integrated flagging for sensitive content
